# Coding Portfolio
## Overview
In this repository, you'll find a collection of code I have chosen to represent my programming knowledge. In addition, I hope it highlights the way I approach problems, my work habits, and what I value in my personal growth.

### leetcode
The leetcode folder contains my solutions for the daily challenges on LeetCode.com. While I truly have a blast figuring out the solutions to these challenges, I find the most joy in what follows after hitting Submit; learning from the code of people who've found faster or smaller solutions, and optimizing my own code with that new knowledge. To that end, the solutions in this folder are narrative; I describe the process I take to get to a solution and the optimization that follows.
