# Coding Portfolio
## Overview
In this repository, you'll find a collection of pieces of code I have chosen to represent my programming knowledge. In addition, I hope it highlights the way I approach problems, my work habits, and what I value in my personal growth.
## Contents
### daily-challenges
The daily-challenges folder contains my solutions for the daily challenges on leetcode.com. While I truly have a blast figuring out the solutions to these challenges, I find the most joy in what follows after hitting Submit; learning from the code of people who've found faster or smaller solutions, and optimizing my own code with that new knowledge. 
### sql
The sql folder, unsurprisingly, is where I put my SQL work. Currently, everything is written in MySQL, though I hope to add tSQL content soon.
#### sql/sql1
Leetcode.com offers "Study Plans" for various topics; currently I'm working through the SQL I plan, but as leetcode doesn't have a placement test feature, I'm starting from the beginning. However, learning opportunities exist everywhere, and if you look for something to get out of a learning experience, you will, so I place Learning Points and Optimization Points in the comments throughout this section as much as I do everywhere else in this portfolio.
