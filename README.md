# Coding Portfolio
## Overview
In this repository, you'll find a collection of code I have chosen to represent my programming knowledge. In addition, I hope it highlights the way I approach problems, my work habits, and what I value in my personal growth.
## Contents
### daily-challenges
The daily-challenges folder contains my solutions for the daily challenges on LeetCode.com. While I truly have a blast figuring out the solutions to these challenges, I find the most joy in what follows after hitting Submit; learning from the code of people who've found faster or smaller solutions, and optimizing my own code with that new knowledge. To that end, the solutions in this folder are narrative; I describe the process I take to get to a solution and the optimization that follows.
### sql
The sql folder, unsurprisingly, is where I put my SQL work.
#### sql/sql1
LeetCode.com offers "Study Plans" for various topics; currently I'm working through the SQL I plan, but as LeetCode doesn't have a placement test feature, I'm starting from the beginning. However, learning opportunities exist everywhere, and if you look for something to get out of a learning experience, you will, so I place Learning Points and Optimization Points in the comments throughout this section as much as I do everywhere else in this portfolio.
